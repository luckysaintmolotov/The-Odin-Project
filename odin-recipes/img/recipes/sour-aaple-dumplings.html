Whether enjoyed on their own or paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce, these apple dumplings are sure to be a hit at any gathering or family dinner!

**Ingredients:**
- 4 Granny Smith apples
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup cold water
- 1 teaspoon caramel flavoring
- 1 large lemon (for juice)
- 500g cake flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 large egg (for the dough)
- Optional: egg yolk for brushing

### Directions:

**Step 1: Prepare the Dough**
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the cake flour and baking powder.
2. Crack the egg into the flour mixture and add the caramel flavoring.
3. Knead the dough until it is smooth and no longer sticky. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour as needed.
4. Once properly kneaded, shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in a cloth or plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

**Step 2: Prepare the Apple Filling**
1. Wash the Granny Smith apples, then peel, core, and chop them into small chunks.
2. In a saucepan, pour in the cold water and add the chopped apples.
3. Squeeze the juice of the lemon over the apples to prevent browning.
4. Cook the apples over medium heat until they are soft.
5. Once the apples are soft, add the brown sugar and stir until the moisture is reduced and you have a chunky syrup. Remove from heat and let cool.

**Step 3: Form the Dumplings**
1. After the dough has rested, sprinkle some flour on your work surface.
2. Roll the dough out to about 1/4 inch thick. Use a round cutter or a glass to cut out circles from the dough.
3. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the apple filling onto the center of each dough circle.
4. Fold the dough over the filling and pinch the edges to seal the dumplings. Repeat until all the filling is used.

**Step 4: Cook the Dumplings**
1. Preheat your air fryer to 150°C (300°F).
2. Place the dumplings in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not overcrowded.
3. If desired, brush the tops of the dumplings with egg yolk for a golden crust.
4. Air fry the dumplings for about 10 minutes, or until they are golden and firm to the touch.

**Step 5: Serve**
1. Allow the dumplings to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm, perhaps with a drizzle of caramel sauce or a scoop of ice cream!
