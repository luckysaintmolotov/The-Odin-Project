Ingredients:

2 ripe mangoes, diced
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1-2 jalape単o peppers, seeded and minced (adjust based on your spice preference)
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
Juice of 1 lime
Salt to taste
Optional: 1 avocado, diced (for creaminess)

Instructions:

Prepare the Ingredients: Start by dicing the mangoes, red onion, red bell pepper, and jalape単os. If using, dice the avocado as well.

Mix the Salsa: In a large bowl, combine the diced mangoes, red onion, jalape単os, red bell pepper, and cilantro.

Add Lime Juice: Squeeze the lime juice over the mixture and gently toss to combine. This will add flavor and help prevent the mango from browning.

Season: Add salt to taste. If you like it spicier, you can add more jalape単o or even a pinch of cayenne pepper.

Optional Avocado: If using avocado, gently fold it in last to avoid mashing it.

Chill and Serve: Let the salsa sit for about 15-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Serve with tortilla chips, grilled chicken, fish, or as a topping for tacos.
